            Lean for Production and Services 
        </h3>

            <p> A popular misconception is that lean is suited only for manufacturing. 
                <p style="color:red;"> 
                    <b>Not true.</b>
                </p>
                Lean applies in every business and every process. It is not a tactic or a cost reduction program, but a way of thinking and acting for an entire organization.
                Businesses in all industries and services, including healthcare and governments, are using lean principles as the way they think and do. Many organizations choose not to use the word lean, but to label what they do as their own system, such as the Toyota Production System or the Danaher Business System. Why? To drive home the point that lean is not a program or short term cost reduction program, but the way the company operates. The word transformation or lean transformation is often used to characterize a company moving from an old way of thinking to lean thinking. It requires a complete transformation on how a company conducts business. This takes a long-term perspective and perseverance.

        Implement KANBAN - 5 steps
    </h3>

        <p>
            Kanban is one of the popular Lean methodologies which software development has borrowed from Lean and added to Agile, which is basically Lean for the IT world asthe method is applicable for almost any sphere, including software development. Here below we will tell you how to implement Kanban.
            The goal of Kanban is to improve workflow - deliver production to the customers within the shortest time, at the same time the quality of the production should be maintained perfect. That means that Kanban project management tools are aimed not only at fast delivery of products, but also at improving their quality. 
            <br>
            In software development this goal is usually achieved by visualizing the workflow and implementing a special Kanban model of project performance. Like other Agile methodologies, Kanban is based on strong customer involvement into the process of work. However, there are also some features that distinguish it from other Agile methods. First of all they are related to iterative cycles. A Kanban cycle is the time required for one user story (or task) to pass all stages of work and enter the column “done” at the Kanban board. In other Agile methodologies the iterative cycles usually have several tasks and are limited in time.
            <br>
            Now, as we know what Kanban actually is, we can talk about its implementation.
            First of all you must have patience, because the implementation of Kanban system at your software development company may be a continuous process. However, its results will definitely not disappoint you. Most specialists define five steps necessary for Kanban implementation.
            <ul>
                <li>
                Visualize your current workflow.
                </li>
                <li>
                Apply Work-in-Process (WIP) limits.
                </li>
                <li>
                Make policies explicit. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Manage and measure flow.  
                </li>
                <li>
                Optimize iteratively with data.  
                </li>
            </ul>
